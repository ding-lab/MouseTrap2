* `test-data contains` NIX5 dataset, which is subset of data from CGC with human + mouse reads
  * this is not a particularly good dataset for TinDaisy, since no variants are discovered
  * TODO: create small test dataset with variants and mouse read contamination 
* Scripts here are designed to test MouseTrap2 in various contexts
